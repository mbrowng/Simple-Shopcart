# Task
Develop a simple Shopping cart application using my own backend.

## Area of demonstration
- Modularity
- Usage of service(s)
- Unit tests
- CSS Styling
- Quality of code over quantity of code
- Responsive design

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 6.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --port 8081` for dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Why this port? Because this app works in conjuntion with a backend service developed in Nodejs

Before, I recommend to execute the NodeJS Backend built for this challenge. To do so, execute `node server.js` the server will run on `http://localhost:8080`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
